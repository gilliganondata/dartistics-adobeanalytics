# dartistics-adobeanalytics
Standalone R examples for Adobe Analytics -- published as a sub-site within dartistics.com

This project is set to publish the HTML to the dartistics.com repository (to a /adobeanalytics folder within the main project folder). So, before building a website with this project, the dartistics.com repo should be located in a directory at the same level as this project's directory.
